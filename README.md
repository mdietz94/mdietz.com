Personal website of Max Dietz

Authored in Coffeescript and Sass, and making use of JQuery, the idea is to have a single page webpage that scrolls with the keyboard and gives the feel of a native application, especially on mobile devices.  The Flask used is only for local testing, because it is simple to start/stop the server, and for actual hosting the files are just copied to an Apache webserver, the code in server.py just outputs index.html.  All code runs on the client.
